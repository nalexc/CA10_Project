\section{Fault Detection}

Fault detection deals with detecting system discrepancies, abnormal behaviour. It is the first step towards handling faults. It doesn't necessarily identify the source of the fault, just establishes the fact that a fault has occurred in the system. The way of isolating faults in redundant actuators is by shutting down the actuator affected by the fault and reassining the shut down actuator's task.
