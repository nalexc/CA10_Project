\section{Fault Detection}

Fault detection deals with detecting system discrepancies, abnormal behaviour. It is the first step towards handling faults. It doesn't necessarily identify the source of the fault, just establishes the fact that a fault has occurred in the system. The way of isolating faults in redundant actuators is by shutting down the actuator affected by the fault and reassining the shut down actuator's task.

\subsection{Reaction Wheel Reconfiguration}
\todo{move reconfig part to fault isolation}
Fault isolation for the redundant reaction wheel configuration can be done by detecting which is the reaction wheel where the fault occurred and shutting it off and redistributing the torques to the rest of the reaction wheels. This reconfiguration can be represented by swapping the corresponding faulty columns to zero vectors. For example, if a fault occurs in the 3rd reaction wheel, the transformation matrix becomes $\underline{A}_{DC,f3}$, as presented in equation \ref{eq:ReactFault}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ReactFault}
\underline{A}_{DC,f3} = \begin{bmatrix}
\vec{Axis^{DC}_{1}}       & \vec{Axis^{DC}_{2}}   & \vec{0}   & \vec{Axis^{DC}_{4}} 
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

The pseudo inverse is calculated in the same manner as presented in equation \ref{eq:motorTrans}, as shown in equation \ref{eq:motorTransFault}. The torque distribution controller scheme which checks for faults in the motors, is presented in Figure \ref{fig:reconfig}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:motorTransFault}
\underline{A}_{DC,f3}^\dagger   = \underline{A}_{DC,f3}^T  (\underline{A}_{DC,f3} \underline{A}_{DC,f3}^T)^{-1}
\end{equation}
