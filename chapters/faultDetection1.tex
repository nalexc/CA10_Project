\section{Fault Detection}

Fault detection deals with detecting system discrepancies and abnormal behaviour. It is the first step towards handling faults. It doesn't necessarily identify the source of the fault, just establishes the fact that a fault has occurred in the system. In redundant systems, fault handling can be achieved by shutting down the actuator affected by the fault and redistributing the control tasks between the functioning actuators.
