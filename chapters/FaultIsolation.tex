\chapter{Fault handling and reconfiguration}  \label{chap:faltHandling}
 \section{Virtual actuators and sensors} \label{chap: virtual}
 Actuators and sensors are subject to various faults in the process. Due to these faults the system may experience drops in performance which could lead to stability loss.
 
 The objective of fault tolerant control using virtual actuators and sensors is to add a reconfiguration block which is presented as an extra layer between the faulty system and the level controller. The purpose of the reconfiguration block in case of a fault is to provide fault tolerance by using the virtual actuators and sensors. As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:VA} the reconfiguration of the faulty actuators is made independently of the main attitude control schemes.  In the figure, $u_f$ represents a low level control input that takes into account the faults of the system, and $y_f$ is the faulty output.

 The reconfiguration of the faulty actuators is made in the adequate actuator subsystems. 
 
 In the case of the reaction wheel subsystem compensation is needed while in the magnetorquers reconfiguration.
 
 In the case that a fault occurs in the reaction wheel sensor, the angular velocity measurement it is assumed functional and based on that measurement, the torque output from the faulty wheel can be computed. A second assumption is that the sensors will completely fail, but in this case a model of how the angular velocity of the wheel is decreasing over time is obtained. This model can be used as a virtual sensor for the angular velocity sensor. 
 
\section{Reaction Wheel Reconfiguration}
\label{sec:rwReconfig}
Fault handling in the redundant reaction wheel configuration can be done by isolating which is the reaction wheel where the fault occurred and shutting it off and redistributing the torques to the rest of the reaction wheels. Fault signals emitted by the fault detection modules are handled by the reconfiguration logic. Section \ref{ref:reactConfig} describes the distribution of reaction wheel torque demand between the reaction wheels. When the reconfiguration system receives a fault signal, it redistributes the $\vec{N_{rw}^d}$ torque demand by modifying $\underline{A}_M$ matrix in equation \ref{eq:transmatrix}. The torque demand for the faulty wheel becomes zero, while the sum of reaction wheel torques are controlled to follow $\vec{N_{rw}^d}$.

This reconfiguration/redistribution can be represented by changing the $\underline{A}_M$ columns corresponding to faulty wheels to zero vectors. For example, if a fault occurs in the 3rd reaction wheel, the transformation matrix becomes $\underline{A}_{M,f3}$, as presented in equation \ref{eq:ReactFault}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ReactFault}
	\underline{A}_{M,f3} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\vec{Axis^{M}_{1}}       & \vec{Axis^{M}_{2}}   & \vec{0}   & \vec{Axis^{M}_{4}} 
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

The pseudo inverse used for transformation between 3D to motor torque is calculated in the same manner as presented in equation \ref{eq:motorTrans}, see equation \ref{eq:motorTransFault}. The torque distribution controller scheme which checks for faults in the motors, is presented in Figure \ref{fig:reconfig}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:motorTransFault}
	\underline{A}_{M,f3}^\dagger   = \underline{A}_{M,f3}^T  (\underline{A}_{M,f3} \underline{A}_{M,f3}^T)^{-1}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:motorTransReconfig2} presents the reconfigured torque distribution equation.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:motorTransReconfig2}
\vec{N_{M}^d} = \underline{A}_{M,f3}^\dagger \vec{N_{rw}^d}  
\end{equation}

\section{Magnetorquer Reconfiguration}
\label{sec:MTReconfig}

\subsubsection{Reconfiguration with compensation in case of Luenberger-like Observer residual fault detection}

Similarly to the reaction wheel reconfiguration \secref{sec:rwReconfig}, fault handling in the redundant magnetorquer scheme can be done by isolating the faulty magnetic component, shutting it off and at the same time turn on the redundant magnetorquer at the same axis. As it has been discussed in \secref{sec:simpleObserver} the Luenberger-like Observer is not robust in the sense of isolating which component is faulty. Therefore, a combination with the structural analysis method \secref{sec: MTStructAnal} can be  made in order to isolate the faulty component. Each method give a flag, commonly a binary input, such that when a fault is present each method indicate 1 and when a fault is absent indicate 0. Moreover, the structural analysis method is also limited on the faults which can detect. Therefore, the binary flags from both methods are inputs to a block which emulates the logic operator $OR$, so if the flags from each method give binary indicator 1, all the magnetorquers are switched which gives robustness in a manner of fault handling. In the \figref{fig:magneticconfig} it can be seen how the main magnetorquers shutting off in the presence of a fault in the power supply at time 150 and their corresponding pair takes action. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that isolation and configuration of only the faulty component can achieved by replacing the $OR$ by $AND$ logic operator, but this will lead in a reduced number of the family of faults that can be handled.
