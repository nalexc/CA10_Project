\subsection{Notations}

Vectors used have a bold typeface, matrices are underlined. 

\begin{equation*}
\textbf{v}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\underline{A}
\end{equation*}

Cross product operations can be evaluated by taking the skew symmetric matrix of the left vector and executing a matrix multiplication. The skew symmetric matrix of $\textbf{v}$ is denoted as $\underline{v}^\times$

\begin{equation*}
	\textbf{w} = \textbf{u} \times \textbf{v} = \underline{u}^\times \textbf{v}
\end{equation*}
