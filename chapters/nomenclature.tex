\subsection{Notations}

Vectors used have a bold typeface, matrices are underlined. 

\begin{equation*}
\textbf{v}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\underline{A}
\end{equation*}

Cross product operations can be evaluated by taking the skew symmetric matrix of the left vector and executing a matrix multiplication. The skew symmetric matrix of $\textbf{v}$ is denoted as $\underline{v}^\times$

\begin{equation*}
	\textbf{w} = \textbf{u} \times \textbf{v} = \underline{u}^\times \textbf{v}
\end{equation*}

If a non-square matrix has to undergo an operation similar to inversion, pseudoinverse is used. Pseudoinverse matrix has the following notation

\begin{equation*}
 \underline{A}^\dagger    =  \underline{A}^T  (\underline{A} \underline{A}^T)^{-1}
\end{equation*}

The majority of equations are expressed in body-fixed frame (BFF). Unless it's not explicitly noted, the matrices and vectors are expressed in BFF. In case the expression is in earth centered inertial frame (ECI), it is noted in the superscript as 

\begin{equation*}
XY^{[I]}
\end{equation*}
