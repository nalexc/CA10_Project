\chapter{Discussion}

State of the art control schemes have been implemented and combined in the simulation environment, adjusted to the specific requirements of fault tolerant control.

The limitation of unknown input observers has been reached with the torque disturbance not being distinguishable from actuator fault. Literature research has shown how observer design becomes significantly more difficult for nonlinear systems.

The thesis has shown that exact identification of the fault source is not required to perform fault tolerant control for redundant actuator system, isolating the actuator where the fault occurred proved sufficient. This relaxes the amount of 'detective work' required in the system.
