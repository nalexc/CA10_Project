\section{Reaction wheels}
%
%Since the focus of the current thesis is not on the design of reaction wheels, only few constraints are  taken into account for the selection of the wheels, such as the weight and the inertia. In order to minimize the total weight of the satellite, the weight of each wheel, is not overcome the %weight of each motor. 

The satellite should be capable of tracking an Earth station in order to be able to downlink data effectively. Tracking a ship requires similar control capability, since the velocity of the wheel is practically zero compared to the velocity of the satellite. Directing the satellite to the nadir continuously only requires keeping a satellite angular velocity equal to the orbit's angular velocity.
Pointing the antennas to the Earth station requires torque from the actuators, the torque demand can be calculated based on the angular acceleration demand for Earth station tracking.
%


 The wheel moment of inertia is \cite{flywheel_design_thesis} $I_{w} = 2.456 [gcm^2]$ and the weight is $m_{w} = 4.201 [g] $ compared to the motor weight $m_{motor} =8 [g] $ and the motor shaft moment of inertia $I_{motor} = 0.0249 [gcm^2]$. The characteristics of the selected motor can be found in appendix \ref{chap: B}. The maximal speed of the motor is $\omega_{max}= 20000[rpm]$ and thus the maximum angular momentum that the system wheel-motor can provide can be found as

%0.000114450   5.1438e-04
which is found to be $5.1438\cdot10^{-4} [Kgm^2/s]$ for each wheel.

For three axis stabilization, three wheels each orthogonal to the principal axis, are efficient but in case of one actuator failure it jeopardizes controllability of the satellite. To avoid this, redundancy is desired, requiring four wheels in tilted positions. The configuration of the wheels is chosen to be in tetrahedron shape giving rise to more reliable and robust system. The tetrahedron configuration will be discussed in section \ref{ref:reactConfig}.  
\subsection{BLDC motor model}
\label{sec:motors}

In order to make the system more reliable, brush-less DC motors are chosen as actuators. BLDC motors are lighter compared to brushed with the same power output and do not causing sparking thus can be used in operations that demand long life and reliability.
%
%\nomenclature[A]{\textbf{BLDC}}{Brushless Direct Current }
Each motor consists of an electrical part and a mechanical part. The electrical part of the motor can be modeled using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law as
%
\begin{flalign}
 V_{a} -V_{R}-V_{L} -V_{e} = 0
\label{Kirchhoff1}
\end{flalign}
%
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$V_{a}$}}{Voltage source }
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$V_{R}$}}{Voltage drop across the resistance }
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$V_{L}$}}{Voltage drop across the inductance }
where $V_{a}$ is the voltage source, $V_{R}$ is the voltage drop across the resistance, $V_{L}$ is the voltage drop across the inductance and $V_{e}$ is the back emf. Equation \ref{Kirchhoff1} can be re written as 
%
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$V_{e}$}}{Back electromotive force- emf }
\begin{flalign}
	V_{a}= R_{a}i + L_{a}\dfrac{di}{dt}+ k_{e}\omega
	\label{Kirchhoff244}
\end{flalign}
%
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$R_{a}$}}{Armature resistance}
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$L_{a}$}}{Armature inductance}
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$k_{e}$}}{Back emf coefficient}
 where $R_{a}$ [Ohm] is the armature resistance, $L_{a}$ [H] is the armature inductance and $k_{e}$ is the back emf coefficient as it can be seen in the \figref{fig:electromech} .

The mechanical part of the motor can be modelled as 
%
\begin{flalign}
 k_{t}i  =J\dfrac{d\omega}{dt} + b\omega
	\label{mechpart66}
\end{flalign}
%
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$k_{t}$}}{Motor torque coefficient}
%\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$b$}}{Viscous friction coefficient}
where $J$ is the rotor moment of inertia, $k_{t}$ [Nm/A] is the motor torque coefficient and $b$ [Nm s/rad] is the viscous friction coefficient. %Assuming the current will not increase rapidly in order not to harm the equipment, and moreover the electrical time constant $\tau_{e}=\dfrac{L}{R}$ is much smaller than the mechanical time constant $\tau_{m}=\dfrac{J}{b}$, the effect of the inductance can be neglected and the
 Equation \ref{mechpart66} can be solved for $i$ and  replaced in \ref{Kirchhoff244}\cite{permanent_magnet}     
%
\begin{flalign}
	i  =\dfrac{J}{k_{t}}\dfrac{d\omega}{dt} + \dfrac{b}{k_{t}}\omega
	\label{mechpart2}
\end{flalign}
%
\begin{flalign}
 V_{a} = \dfrac{LJ}{k_{t}}\dfrac{d^{2}\omega}{dt^{2}}+\dfrac{RJ+Lb}{k_{t}}\dfrac{d\omega}{dt} +\dfrac{Rbk_{e}}{k_{t}}\omega 
	\label{mechpart333}
\end{flalign}
%
by Laplace transformed \ref{mechpart333}, the second order transfer function from $V_{a}$ to $ \omega $ can be written as 
%
\begin{flalign}
	\dfrac{\omega(s)}{V_{a}(s)}= \dfrac{k_{t}}{LJs^{2}+(RJ+Lb)s+(Rb+k_{e}k_{t})}
	\label{tf}
\end{flalign}
%= \dfrac{k_{t}}{LJs^{2}+(RJ+Lb)s+Rb+k_{e}k_{t}}
%\label{tf}
following \cite{permanent_magnet} the electrical time constant $\tau_{e}$ and mechanical time constant $\tau_{m}$ can be written respectively $\tau_{e} = \frac{LJ}{RJ+Lb}$ and $\tau_{m} = \frac{RJ+LB}{RB+k_{e}k_{t}}$, the values for the two time constants are found to be $\tau_{e} = 1.2709\cdot10^{-10}$[s] and $\tau_{m} = 8.4102\cdot10^{-4}$[s] thus since the $\tau_{e}$ is very small compared to $\tau_{m}$, the effect of inductance can be neglected thus the transfer function from $V_{a}$ to $ \omega $ is reduced to a first order transfer function as 
%
\begin{flalign}
\dfrac{\omega(s)}{V_{a}(s)}= \dfrac{k_{t}}{R(Js+b)+k_{e}k_{t}}
\label{tf2}
\end{flalign}
%
the block diagram of the system can be seen in figure \ref{fig:blockdi} along with PI velocity controller which will be discussed in the next section.
