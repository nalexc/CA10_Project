\chapter{Control Schemes}
\textit{The satellite control schemes are introduced starting from the top of the hierarchy. The chosen reaction wheel desaturation control scheme determines the overall control structure, while allowing modification of other control blocks, making the system modular. Three different main attitude controllers are discussed}.

%\sout{In this chapter the purpose is to describe the design of the controllers for the satellite. First, a desaturation controller is designed for distributing the torque between the actuators. A second controller is the hybrid attitude one, which is capable of taking care of the tumble of the satellite. Next, based on previous work, two types of attitude controllers are designed. For making a comparison between a linear controller and non-linear one, a state feedback controller and a sliding mode controller are presented.}

When developing complex systems, using a modular design, setting up a hierarchy between elements, and using abstractions can be very helpful in keeping the complexity at a manageable level. They can also prove to be useful during debugging or finding faults in the system. The proposed control scheme utilizes these tools. Figure  \ref{fig:mainLoop} introduces the high-level control scheme used in the thesis. The scheme is inspired by the control scheme proposed by Trégouët et al. in their paper concerning a new desaturation control scheme \cite{DesatTregouet}. 

%The proposed high-level control scheme presented in figure \ref{fig:mainLoop} has a hierarchical, modular structure.
 The main attitude controller outputs a torque reference for the actuators, which is then distributed by lower level controllers. This means that the attitude controller can be swapped without having to modify the lower level controllers. The desaturation controller distributes the torque between the reaction wheels and magnetorquers. The reaction wheel subsystem executes local fault detection and fault isolation. It receives a three dimensional torque demand and distributes it between the individual reaction wheel motors. The reaction wheel subsystem checks fault residual signals and adjusts torque distribution between reaction wheels accordingly. These will be elaborated in subsequent sections.

In the following sections \ref{sec:LC} and \ref{sec:SM}  will be discussed two attitude controller designs that are based on previous work \cite{PrevPro}. The two controllers calculate a torque demand that has to be produced from the motors. The first controller is based on the linearized model \eqref{eq:lele}, and thus is characterized as linear state feedback control, while the second one is based on the non-linear dynamics \eqref{eq:seom} creating a sliding manifold, a hyperplane, such that when the states are on the manifold, will converge to the desired reference. The non-linear controller is called Sliding Mode Control (SMC).\nomenclature[AS]{\textbf{SMC}}{Sliding Mode Control}

\subsection{Linear attitude controller} \label{sec:LC}

The system's equilibrium operating in nadir is defined between the orbit frame and the body frame. The angular rate between the frames should be zero $\vec{ ^s_o  \omega} = 0$ and the two frames should be aligned thus the relative attitude quaternion is $[0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1]^{T}$. Therefore,  $ \parallel \vec{ {\bar{\omega}}} \parallel $ is equal to the orbital angular velocity, and equation \ref{eq:lele} following \cite{Rafael} can be written as  
%
\begin{flalign}
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{ \dot {\tilde{q}}(t) } \\
\vec{ \dot {\tilde{\omega}}(t) }
\end{bmatrix} 	
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &0& 0&\frac{1}{2} &0&0& \\
0 &0& {\omega_{o}}&0 &\frac{1}{2}&0& \\
0 &-{\omega_{o}}& 0&0&0&\frac{1}{2}& \\
-2\sigma_{x} &0& 0&0 &0&0& \\
0 &2\sigma_{y}& 0&0 &0&{\omega_{o}}\sigma_{y} \\
0 &0& 0&0 &{\omega_{o}}\sigma_{z}&0& \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{  {\tilde{q}}(t) } \\
{  {\tilde{\vec \omega}}(t) }
\end{bmatrix} 	
-
\begin{bmatrix}
\underline{\vec 0}_{(3\times3)} \\
{\underline I_{s}^{-1}}
\end{bmatrix} 	
\vec {\tilde N_{ctrl}}
\label{eq:lelele}
\end{flalign}
%
with $\sigma_{x}= \frac{I_{y}-I_{z}}{I_{x}}$,$\sigma_{y}=\frac{I_{z}-I_{x}}{I_{y}}$,$\sigma_{z}=\frac{I_{x}-I_{y}}{I_{z}}$ and $I_{x} = 0.0017$, $I_{y}=0.0022$, $I_{z}=0.0022$ been the values of the inertia matrix and ${\omega_{o}}\approx0.0011 $ is the orbital angular rate. The linearization is made for the angular velocity between the control frame and the orbit frame be equal to zero and the two frames are aligned thus the .     
Moreover, by comparing the values of  matrix \eqref{eq:lelele} it can be seen that the value $\frac{1}{2}$ is larger compared to the other values thus \eqref{eq:lelele} can be simplified to 
\begin{flalign}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\vec{ \dot {\tilde{q}}(t) } \\
		\vec{ \dot {\tilde{\omega}}(t) }
	\end{bmatrix} 	
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\underline{ 0}_{(3\times3)} &	\frac{1}{2} \underline{\vec 1}_{(3\times3)} \\
		\underline{ 0}_{(3\times3)} &	\underline{ 0}_{(3\times3)}
	\end{bmatrix} 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\vec{  {\tilde{q}}(t) } \\
		{  {\tilde{\vec \omega}}(t) }
	\end{bmatrix} 	
	-
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\underline{\vec 0}_{(3\times3)} \\
		{\underline I_{s}^{-1}}
	\end{bmatrix} 	
	\vec {\tilde N_{ctrl}}
	\label{eq:lelelele}
\end{flalign}
Three equal subsystems can be derived from \eqref{eq:lelelele} as
\begin{flalign}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot { \tilde {q_{i}}} \\
		\dot { \tilde { \omega_{i}}}
	\end{bmatrix} 	
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0&	\frac{1}{2}  \\
		0 &	 0
	\end{bmatrix} 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\tilde{q_{i}}(t)  \\
		\tilde{\omega_{i}}(t) 
	\end{bmatrix} 	
	-
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 \\
		I_{i,s}^{-1}
	\end{bmatrix} 	
	\tilde{N_{i}}
	\label{eq:subsys}
\end{flalign}
with $i = 1, 2, 3 $. The control torque was defined by the state feedback law as 
\begin{flalign}
	N_{i}^{d}	
	= 
	-
	\begin{bmatrix}
		k_{1} &	k_{2} 	
	\end{bmatrix} 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\tilde{q_{i}}(t)  \\
		\tilde{\omega_{i}}(t) 
	\end{bmatrix} 	
	\label{eq:inputtorque}
\end{flalign}
leading to a second order closed loop system calculated as $det(s\underline{I} - (\underline{A} - \underline{BK}) )$. Identifying  this with a general second order equation $s^{2}+2\zeta\omega_{n}s+\omega_{n}^{2}$, with $\zeta$ be the dumping factor which was chosen to be equal to 1 leading to an over dumped response and $\omega_{n}$  the natural frequency $\omega_{n} =  \frac{2\pi}{60/0.35} $ with 60 be the value of the chosen rise time. The controller gains was derived as

\begin{flalign*}
	k_{1} = -2 I_{i,s} \omega_{n}^{2} 
	\label{eq:gainsl22}
\end{flalign*}
\begin{flalign*}
	k_{2} = -2\zeta I_{i,s} \omega_{n}^{2} 
	\label{eq:gainsl223}
\end{flalign*}
Since the matrix $\underline{A}$ is affine,   stability analysis was made for all the values of $ \vec{ {\bar{\omega}}}$ evaluated on the vertices of the convex polyhedron for the all values of $ \vec{ {\bar{\omega}}} $\cite{PrevPro} giving maximum eigenvalue $-0.0308$. In the figure \ref{fig:linear demand} it is seen the torque demand from the linear controller for nadir pointing reference.

\subsection{Sliding mode control} \label{sec:SM}
As described previously the sliding mode control scheme belongs to the class of non-linear control designs. The objective of the SMC is the design, from a geometrical point of view, of a manifold in the state space, denoted as $s$, which whenever the state trajectory is on the manifold ($s = 0$) it is constraint such that the behavior of the system will meet the specifications it is designed for, i.e convergence to the desired reference. In the \figref{fig:SM} it can be seen how the states slide on the hyperplane towards origin.

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/SM}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Sliding variable design}
Introducing the small signal deviation for the quaternion error as
\begin{flalign}
\vec{\tilde{q}} = \vec{  \bar{q}}^{-1} \otimes \vec{ q} 
\label{eq:smallsignal22}
\end{flalign}
with $\vec{  \bar{q}}^{-1}$ be the desired reference quaternion and $\vec{ q} $ be the measured, and for the angular velocity as 
\begin{flalign}
\vec{\tilde{\omega}}  = \vec{\omega}-\vec{\bar{\omega}}  
\label{eq:smallsi4gnal4566}
\end{flalign}
with $\vec{\bar{\omega}}$ be the nominal value of the angular velocity. The sliding variable can now be written in terms of the error signals as  %\nomenclature[S]{s}{Sliding variable} and is chosen to be 
\begin{flalign}
s  = \underline{F}\vec{\tilde{q}} + \vec{\tilde{\omega}}  
\label{eq:sliding variable}
\end{flalign}
with $\underline{F} = \alpha\underline{\vec 1}_{3\times3}$ be a positive definite matrix. It can be seen that for $s=0$, the motion on the sliding surface is governed by $\vec{\tilde{\omega}} = - \alpha\vec{\tilde{q}_{1:3}}$, where $\vec{\tilde{q}_{1:3}}$ denotes the vector part of the quaternion, and $\alpha$ is chosen appropriately through trial and error to give the desired convergence for $\vec{\tilde{q}}$ which for the desired alignment between frames is $[0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1]^{T}$. In order to prove this, differentiation of \eqref{eq:smallsignal22} following \cite{TH} is written as
%
\begin{flalign}
\vec{\dot{\tilde{q}}}  = \frac{1}{2}(-\vec{q_{\bar{\omega}}}\otimes\vec{\tilde{q}}+ \vec{\tilde{q}}\otimes\vec{q_{\bar{\omega}}}+\vec{\tilde{q}}\otimes\vec{q_{\tilde{\omega}}}) 
\label{eq:sliding stability}
\end{flalign}
%
with $\vec{q_{\bar{\omega}}} = \bar{\omega_{1}}i + \bar{\omega_{2}}j+\bar{\omega_{3}}k + 0$ and $\vec{q_{\tilde{\omega}}} = \tilde{\omega_{1}}i + \tilde{\omega_{2}}j+\tilde{\omega_{3}}k + 0$.
From equation \ref{eq:sliding stability} the real part of the quaternion error can be written as 
%
\begin{flalign}
\dot{\tilde{q_{4}}}  = -\frac{1}{2} \vec{\tilde{\omega}} \cdot \vec{\tilde{q}_{1:3}} = \frac{\alpha}{2} \rVert \vec{\tilde{q}_{1:3}} \rVert^{2} = \frac{\alpha}{2}(1 -\tilde{q_{4}}^{2})
\label{eq:sliding realpart}
\end{flalign}
%
It can be seen that $\vec{\tilde{q}} \longrightarrow [0\ 0\ 0\ 1]^{T}$ with a desired rate given by $\alpha$. Figure \ref{fig:quaterror} showing the $\vec{\tilde{q}}$ converging with rate given by $\alpha = 0.035$

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/quaternion_error}
	\caption{shows the quaternion error converging with $\alpha = 0.035$ }
	\label{fig:quaterror}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Sliding condition - Control law}
The variable $s$ can be driven to 0 by making use of a Lyapunov candidate function as
\begin{flalign}
V  = \frac{1}{2} \vec{s}^{T}\vec{s} 
\label{eq:sliding variable333}
\end{flalign} 
and in order to prove stability around $s=0$ a necessary condition is $\dot{V} < 0 $ for each $s\neq0$. The time derivative of equation \ref{eq:sliding variable333} is written as
\begin{flalign}
\dot{V}  = \frac{1}{2}( \dot{\vec{s}^{T}}\vec{s}+\vec{s}^{T}\dot{\vec{s}}) 
\label{eq:sliding variable33333}
\end{flalign}
showing that $\vec{s}^{T}\dot{\vec{s}} < 0 $ $\forall s\neq0$ the condition may be satisfied.
Substituting equation \ref{eq:sliding variable} is obtained
\begin{flalign}
\dot{V}  = \vec{s}^{T}\dot{\vec{s}}  = \vec{s}^{T} (\underline{F}{\vec{\dot{\tilde{q}}}} + {\vec{\dot{\tilde{\omega}}}}) 
\label{eq:e33333}
\end{flalign}
and thus replacing the dynamic equation \ref{eq:seom}, equation \ref{eq:e33333} may be written as 


\begin{flalign}
\dot{V}  = \vec{s}^{T}\underline{I}_{s}^{-1}(-\underline{{\omega}}^\times\underline{I}_{s}\vec{\omega}-\underline{{\omega}}^\times\vec{h_{rw}}+\vec{N_{rw}^{d}}+\vec{N_{mt}}+\vec{N_{dis}} - \underline{I}_{s}\dot{\bar{\omega}} +\underline{I}_{s}\underline{F}{\vec{\dot{\tilde{q}}}} ) 
\label{eq:444444}
\end{flalign}
designing the control as
\begin{flalign}
\vec{N_{rw}^{d}}  = \underline{{\omega}}^\times\underline{I}_{s}\vec{\omega}+\underline{{\omega}}^\times\vec{h_{rw}} + \underline{I}_{s}\dot{\omega} -\underline{I}_{s}\underline{F}{\vec{\dot{\tilde{q}}}}-\underline{I}_{s}\lambda sign(\vec{s})  ) 
\label{eq:555555}
\end{flalign}

equation \ref{eq:444444} is written as
\begin{flalign}
\dot{V}  = -\vec{s}^{T}(-{\vec{\dot{\tilde{\omega}}}} + \lambda sign(\vec{s}) -\vec{N_{mt}}-\vec{N_{dist}} ) 
\label{eq:stability}
\end{flalign}
Eventually, it can be seen that choosing $\lambda > \lVert{\vec{\dot{\tilde{\omega}}_{max}}} \rVert + \lVert \vec{N_{mt}} \rVert + \lVert \vec{N_{dist}} \rVert $ the condition $\dot{V} < 0 $ is satisfied. Sign function presents chattering around the manifold which is undesirable, thus the sign function is replaced with the hyperbolic tangent function $tanh$ which is smoother. In the figure \ref{fig:slidingtorque} is depicted the torque demand the sliding mode controller outputs. It can be seen that is more aggressive compared to the linear controller discussed in previous chapter, and furthermore it can be seen that the torque converging slower compared to the linear controller since the SMC need to bring the states to the manifold.
