Satellites are no longer the privilege of just a handful of economic powerhouses such as nations or mega companies. There are currently 1738 active satellites orbiting Earth, 129 of it is categorized as having civil uses, created mostly for educational purposes.


 While the satellites themselves can be chosen to be engineered relatively cheaply, there is no avoiding the high cost of putting the satellite into orbit. Many efforts were made recently to reduce this cost.  Since the cost is highly dependent on the weight of the satellite, thus by minimizing the weight, a lot of money can be saved. The per kilogram cost of putting an object to LEO orbit in the case of Falcon Heavy, 1655 USD \cite{spaceX}, however this price only applies for 54400 kg payload. There are rockets missions with the purpose of putting several satellites into orbit, thus reducing the cost for individual satellites. AAU CUBESAT cost 49000 USD to put in orbit \cite{AAUSATpres}. \todo{find weight}
