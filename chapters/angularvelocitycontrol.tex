\subsection*{ Angular velocity control}

In the previous chapters has been discussed how the control demand is calculated through different nature controllers. This torque demand is used to give the desired angular velocity reference for the wheels and thus the torque that will be fed back to the satellite. The output torque from the linear and non-linear controllers has three elements which has to be transformed in the tetrahedron configuration using the matrix \eqref{eq:transmatrix}.  A \textit{PI} controller has been designed to control the angular velocity of the motor as seen in the \figref{fig:blockdi}:

%\end{figure}

The PI controller gains are chosen by trial and error in order to achieve faster closed loop response, settling time less than 1 $s$, zero steady state error and asymptotically stable system. The gains are chosen to be:   
%
\begin{flalign*}
	k_{p} = 0.006 \\
	k_{i} = 6
\end{flalign*}
\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$k_{p}$}}{Proportional gain of PI control}
\nomenclature[S]{\textbf{$k_{i}$}}{Integral gain of PI control}
%
%In the \figref{fig:closedloopsys} it can be seen the closed loop step response with PI control for one motor. The closed loop system gives a small overshoot, however, it is deemed good for simulation.

The root locus of one motor with PI controller is seen in the \figref{fig:rlocus33}

\end{figure}
Furthermore, its is worth showing how the poles moving when the motor reach saturation mode and thus the gain becomes 0 which can be seen in \figref{fig:rlocus44}.

	\caption{Root locus of one motor with PI controller when the gain K becomes 0}
	\label{fig:rlocus44}
\end{figure}
%Furthermore in the \figref{fig:rlocus44}  it can be seen how the poles of the closed loop system are moving to the right half plane, by setting the gain $k_{p}$ to 0, and thus causing saturation of the motor(it is depicted the original without zoom in to the left and with zoom in to the right )
