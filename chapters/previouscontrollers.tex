\chapter{Torque demand source}

In the following chapter will be discussed shortly two attitude controller designs that are based on previous work. The two controllers calculate a torque demand that has to be produced from the motors. The first controller is based on the linearized model \eqref{eq:lele}, and thus is characterized as linear state feedback control, while the second one is based in the non-linear dynamics \eqref{eq:seom}
