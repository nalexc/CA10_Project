Inertial coordinate systems are frames where Newton's 3 laws of dynamics apply

\subsubsection{Earth Centered Inertial Frame (ECI)}
Earth is rotating and is orbiting the Sun, it accelerates in the direction of the Sun's center of mass, the Sun is orbiting the center of the Milky Way, etc. Thus the frame fixed to Earth's surface is not an inertial frame- But in the case of earth orbiting satellites, there exists a coordinate system attached to Earth's center that out of practical considerations can be treated as one, the Earth Centered Inertial Frame (ECI).
